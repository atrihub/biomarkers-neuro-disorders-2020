This repository hosts the course materials for the biostatistics module of the [Biomarkers in Neurodegenerative Disorders](https://fubasdoc.gu.se/fubasextern/info?kurs=SN00030) course at University of Gothenburg, April 20 to 24, 2020.

Statistical and visualization techniques will be demonstrated using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) applied to data from the [Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/). If you would like to execute the R code on your own machine, you should [apply for access](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/access-data/) to ADNI and [download and install the ADNIMERGE R package](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/instruction-ADNIMERGE-packages.pdf).

[RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) is also highly recommended.


The biostatistics module is from *9:00 to 12:00 on Monday April 24, 2020*. Topics include:

### Biostatistics for Fluid Biomarkers (9:00-9:50)

- Batch Effects
- Experimental Design (Sample Randomization)
- Statistical Models for Assay Calibration/Quantification
- Classification (Supervised Learning)
  - Logistic Regression
  - Binary Trees
  - Random Forest
- Mixture Modeling (Unsupervised Learning)
  - Univariate
  - Bivariate

### Biostatistics for Imaging Biomarkers (10:00-10:50)

- Reference Regions
- Centiloids
- Machine Learning

### Modeling Longitudinal Data (11:00-11:50)

- Visualizing longitudinal Data
- Mixed-effect models
- Modeling correlated residuals
