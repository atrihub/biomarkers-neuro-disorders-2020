This repository hosts the course materials for the biostatistics module of the [Biomarkers in Neurodegenerative Disorders](https://fubasdoc.gu.se/fubasextern/info?kurs=SN00030) course at University of Gothenburg, April 20 to 24, 2020.

Statistical and visualization techniques will be demonstrated using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) applied to data from the [Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/). If you would like to execute the R code on your own machine, you should [apply for access](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/access-data/) to ADNI and [download and install the ADNIMERGE R package](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/instruction-ADNIMERGE-packages.pdf).

[RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) is also highly recommended.


The biostatistics module is from *9:00AM to 12:00PM Tuesday May 25, 2021*. Topics include:

### Biostatistics for Fluid Biomarkers (9:00-9:50)

* Calibration
* Batch effects
* Regression
* Classification

### Biostatistics for Imaging Biomarkers (10:00-10:50)

* Reference regions
* Centiloids
* Machine learning

### Longitudinal Date (11:00-11:50)
